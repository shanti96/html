            <p>History of Python<hr color="blue" width="100" align="left" size="20"><br>
             Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. <br>
                It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. <br>
                It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability,and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.</p>
